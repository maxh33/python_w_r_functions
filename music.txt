Cinema
Benny Benassi Skrillex Remix 

I could watch you for a lifetime
You're my favorite movie
A thousand endings
You mean everything to me
I never know what's coming
Forever fascinating
Hope you don't stop running
To me 'cause I'll always be waiting
You are my cinema, I could watch you forever
Action-thriller, I could watch you forever
You are my cinema, a Hollywood treasure
Love you just the way you are
My cinema, my cinema
Stars spell out your name
Like in a science fiction drama
Romance growing
Like a flower in the summer
You always keep me guessing
Forever my wonder
Hope you start undressing
All my dreams and take me under
You are my cinema, I could watch you forever
Action-thriller, I could watch you forever
You are my cinema, a Hollywood treasure
Love you just the way you are
My cinema, my cinema
Never know what movie you're playing
Never know what movie you're playing
Never know what movie you're playing
Never know, never know, never know
You are my cinema, I could watch you forever
Action-thriller, I could watch you forever
You are my cinema, a Hollywood treasure
Love you just the way you are
My cinema, my cinema
